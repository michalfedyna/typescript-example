# Hello World

:difficulty{difficulty="warm-up"}

In type challenges, we use the type system itself to do the assertion.

For this challenge, you will need to change the following code to make the tests pass (no type check errors).

### Challenge

In this challenge, `HelloWorld` is expected to be a string.

```typescript
type HelloWorld = any;
```

### Test Case

This will be your test case, you should make this work without errors.

```typescript
type test = Expect<Equal<HelloWorld, string>>;
```

### Typescript Playground

::open-playground

```typescript
type HelloWorld = any; // expected to be a string

// Test Cases
import type { Equal, Expect, NotAny } from "@type-challenges/utils";

type cases = [Expect<NotAny<HelloWorld>>, Expect<Equal<HelloWorld, string>>];
```
